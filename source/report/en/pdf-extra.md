\blandscape

## Landscape

Sometime is is useful to set a few pages in landscape.
E.g. when you need to display a very wide table.
Place the command `\blandscape` at the start of the things you want in landscape.
Note that this will start a new page at that location.
Use `\elandscape` to return to normal mode.
This will start a new page as well.
The code will have no effect on other output formats.

\elandscape
